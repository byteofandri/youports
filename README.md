# Report that Channel!
### An Automatic YouTube Reporting Tool


### The Situation

Some YouTube channels could be served as a government's propaganda, which allows the spread of disinformation, and also content that violate human rights. 

### The Task

To create a tool that help users quickly report the video created by these propaganda channels, maximising the chance of these chanenls being taken down by YouTube.
### The Action

This tool is to leverage the YouTube API, and allow users to report each channel automatically - save your time to do something else.  

#### Something to consider...

We have to be very careful to determine which goes into the "bad list". Also, should we consider to shuffle the list a bit, so that it won't be acting as suspicious behaviors to YouTube? Furthermore, would we be able to centralize the process, hence enable us keep track of how many people actually report the channels using these tools?



## Installation

The tool is developed based on Python 3. We recommend using a virtual environment to run the program. 

## Usage

```bash
python retrieve_link.py
python youtube_test.py
```
